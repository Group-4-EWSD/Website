We used Laravel PHP in the backend and Vue.Js for the frontend.
To run the project locally, go to backend folder and run with this command,
php artisan serve
Then, go to frontend folder and run  this command
npm run dev
In this way, frontend and backend source codes with interact each other to run the project.
